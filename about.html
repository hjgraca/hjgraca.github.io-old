<p>I'm Henrique Gra√ßa, an agile software developer and solutions architect based in Lisbon and working for Microsoft.</p>
<p>Throughout my career I've built many desktop client applications and WebSites, using Microsoft Technologies, my weapons of choice are ASP.NET MVC, C#, Html and JavaScript.</p>
<p>I'm very passionate about developing amazing scalable websites using best practices, clean code, unit testing and keeping SOLID principles always in mind. I'm a team player, agile extreme programming enthusiast, pair programming and mentor.</p>
<p>Experience with cloud platforms AWS and Azure, DevOps, building and maintaining continuous integration/deployment systems using GitHub, TeamCity and VSTS.</p>	
<p>Although I'm a C# guy I do a lot of Frontend work, and unlike most people I love JavaScript and all the frameworks around it. I have experience with AngularJs and React.JS. I also play around with python, ruby and Go.</p>
<p>I'm always keen to learn new languages, technologies, methodologies and better ways to use technology to help people get the right experience whilst using my applications. I love automation and try to script everything that could help my teams make less mistakes and deliver features quickly.</p>
<p>On my spare time I read Programming and Management books. I try to keep up to date with everything related to Web Development and I'm also enrolled in many online courses.</p>
<p>Most of all I love what I do, I couldn't imagine doing something else. When you have this passion it doesn't seem like work, it's a blessing to be in this situation.</p>
