<p>I'm Henrique, a software developer born in Lisbon, Portugal but currently living in the beatuiful and busy city of London, Uk.</p>
<p>My passion is all about creating amazing and well designed websites, for building them my weapons of choice are ASP.NET Mvc, c#, Html and Javascript.</p>
<p>Although I'm a c# guy I do a lot of frontend work, and unlike most people I have a thing for Javascript and all the frameworks around it. I have experience and used AngularJs on many live projects.</p>
<p>Currently I'm teaching myself, Grunt, Bower and yeoman for development automation, also loving the work Microsoft is doing with Windows Azure, I have created some projects using DocumentDB and Azure Search services.</p>
<p>On my spare time I read Programming and Management books. I try to keep up to date with everything related to web development and I'm also enrolled in some online courses being the last one related to Objective-c and Cocoa Touch.</p>
<p>Most of all I love what I do, I couldn't imagine doing something else. When you have this passion it doesn't seem like work, it's a blessing to be in this situation.</p>
